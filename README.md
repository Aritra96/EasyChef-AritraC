# The Easy Chef Project

_Because who doesn't love cooking? Well, plenty as it turns out..._

# Project Overview

Well, on the face of it, it is the website of an up and coming start-up "Easy Chef" with all its details, in all its glory.

In reality, it is a poor attempt at making something too ambitious to be completed by a n00b in less than a day.
Ok, so the point is, the "web app" as we see it now, is a simple To-Do list to add and remove Grocery Items with massively fancy design that is designed to obfuscate its intended purpose (which isn't a whole lot developed yet, hence, the obfuscation).

Given enough time, however, it has the potential to become the app it is destined to be. Currently just a Beta. Or even Charlie? Or Delta? 

To quote from a famous Batman movie (The Dark Knight),"It is the app SWENG (read: Software Engineering) deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll critique it down. Because it can take it. Because it is not our hero. It is a silent CSS-bomb, a Vue-ful protector, A dark website." 

### Running the program

All you have to do is double-click the index.html file and it'll take you straight to our app. Once you're in, you can use the list at the bottom of the page to add your grocery items.

### Program Details

This is currently a UI-heavy webpage/webapp that talks about EasyChef's offering and has a small list program at the bottom of the page to help you keep track of your grocery items by adding them to a list. 

Upon user input, it builds the list one by one for each item. You also enjoy the functionality to remove any items in any order from the list.
