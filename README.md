# The Easy Chef Project
This is a repository dedicated to the final assessment component for the Software Engineering course at SSLA. 

So what does this project really do?

Well, on the face, it is the website of an up and coming start-up "Easy Chef" with all its details, in all its glory.

In reality, it is a poor attempt at making something too ambitious to be completed by a n00b in less than a day.
Ok, so the point is, the "web app" as we see it now, is a simple To-Do list to add and remove Grocery Items with massively fancy design that is designed to obfuscate its intended purpose (which isn't a whole lot developed yet, hence, the obfuscation).

Given enough time, however, it has the potential to become the app it is destined to be. Currently just a Beta. 

To quote from a famous Batman movie (The Dark Knight),"It is the app SWENG deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So we'll critique it down. Because it can take it. Because it is not our hero. It is a silent CSS-bomb, a Vue-ful protector, A dark website."
